<h1>A BIT OF INTRO ABOUT MYSELF...</h1>
<p>
	I WAS BORN IN RAXAUL,BIHAR.I HAVE LIVED IN SEVERAL PLACES IN BIHAR AND JHARKHAND WHICH INCLUDES LAKKHISARAI,MADHUBANI,MOTIPUR,BHAGALPUR,DUMKA AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DEOGHAR.<br /><br />I MOVED TO DEOGHAR WHEN I WAS IN CLASS 6 AND TILL CLASS 10,I STUDIED IN ST. FRANCIS SCHOOL,DEOGHAR.A MAJOR PART OF MY CHARACTER REFLECTS DEOGHAR.<br /><br />I DID MY I.Sc FROM DELHI PUBLIC SCHOOL,B.S.CITY.THOSE TWO YEARS WERE PERHAPS THE MOST THRILLING YEARS OF MY LIFE.I MUST SAY CLASS 12B WAS PERHAPS THE MOST CIVILISED CLASS IN WHICH I EVER STUDIED(no sarcasm included).THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF BEING IN COMPANY OF GENIUS FELLOWS(especially KARAN KUMAR) GAVE EACH ONE OF US REGULAR ADRENALINE RUSH AND THE MOTIVATION TO STUDY.I DONT KNOW WHY BUT SOMETIMES I MISS THOSE DAYS.<br /><br /> 
	WELL,NOW ITS TIME TO SAY ABOUT THE NEXT PHASE OF MY LIFE,<em>" THE KGP LIFE"</em>.MY FIRST YEAR WAS A "PEACE"-full YEAR WITH WHOLE LOT OF CHILLING AND WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WORK AND TENSION(which ofcourse was not supposed to be).I WILL WRITE MORE ABOUT IT IN THE NEXT SECTION.HAVE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES BELOW TO KNOW ABOUT SFS AND DPS.HOVER OVER THE IMAGES TO HAVE A LOOK.
